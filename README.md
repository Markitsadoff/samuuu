# Samurai Clicker (Frontend only)
This is a ready-to-deploy frontend React + Vite project (offline mode).

How to use:
1. Unzip, open the folder, upload the CONTENTS (not the folder) to your GitHub repository.
2. Ensure `index.html`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, and `src/` are in the repo root.
3. Vercel will detect Vite and deploy automatically. Open your Vercel URL to see the game.
